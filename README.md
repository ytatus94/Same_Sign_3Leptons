# SS_v37
This is SS/3L+jet cutflows study.
Sample:  user.jpoveda.t0756_v37.410080.MadGraphPythia8EvtGen_A14NNPDF23_4topSM.DAOD_SUSY2.s2608_r7725_p2613_output.root

v04: Add EventNumber protection.
1. Using the passOR vectors to fill the signal vectors.
2. Adding vec_event_number to save EventNumber. Use this mechanism to protect the channel selection part. All the events used in channel selection must be the events pass same-sign cut.

v03: Add channel selection
Adding codes for channel selection. As long as there are at lease two signal leptons with pT>20 GeV, we donâ€™t require the pT of same sign pair greater than 20 GeV.


v02: Make RootCore package structure.
Creating folders and moving files to the corresponding folders such that the structure satisfies the RootCore requirement.


v01: First commit
The cutflow works to same sign cut.
